## **Step 1: Define the Game and Its Rules**

**In this section:** You need to decide what the game will do, how it will behave, and what counts as success or failure. Think about the main objects, the player, and the goals.

**Question:** What do you think your first step should be when creating a cat-themed game?

---

## **Step 2: Set Up Your Project Files**

**In this section:** You need to create the basic files for your project: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JS for game logic. Also, you need to connect them together so they can interact.

**Question:** If you were starting from scratch, what files would you create first, and what would go inside them?

---

## **Step 3: Create the Game Area and Player**

**In this section:** You need to decide how the game looks and where the player character will be. Think about how you’ll position the player in the game area and how it can move.

**Question:** How do you think you could represent the cat and make sure it can move inside a game area?

---

## **Step 4: Represent Game State with Variables**

**In this section:** You need to identify the numbers and strings that will track the game’s progress, like score, lives, or positions. Decide which variables change and which stay constant.

**Question:** What variables do you think you will need to track for the game?

---

## **Step 5: Handle Player Input**

**In this section:** You need to figure out how the player will control the cat. Think about keyboard events, updating the player’s position, and making sure it doesn’t leave the game area.

**Question:** How would you let the player move the cat left or right?

---

## **Step 6: Create Falling Objects (Fish)**

**In this section:** You need to create objects that move on their own, track them in some kind of collection (like an array), and randomly position them.

**Question:** How do you think you could make fish appear at the top and start falling?

---

## **Step 7: Update the Game Loop**

**In this section:** You need to continuously update the positions of moving objects, check for collisions, and handle what happens when the player catches or misses something.

**Question:** How would you keep moving the fish and check if the cat catches them?

---

## **Step 8: Update the Score and Lives**

**In this section:** You need to show the player’s progress. Decide how to increase score, decrease lives, and update the display in real time.

**Question:** When a fish is caught, what should happen to the score and how would you show it on the screen?

---

## **Step 9: Handle Game Over**

**In this section:** You need to decide what happens when the player loses all lives. Think about restarting or ending the game.

**Question:** What would you do when lives reach zero?

---

## **Step 10: Test and Refine**

**In this section:** You need to play your game, check for bugs, fix them, and maybe tweak difficulty or visuals.

**Question:** How would you test that everything is working correctly?
