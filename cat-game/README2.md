// This space is specifically for notes and questions to help guide me through this project.

Step 1: Define game idea (initally based on pong idea)

- control a cat that can move left and right
- fish fall from the top at random places
- catching a fish increases the score
- missing a fish decreases lives
- game ends when lives reach 0

Questions to think about:

- How will you represent the cat and fish?
- How will you know where the cat is and where the fish are? (Position variables)
- How will you detect collisions? (Check positions overlap)
- Hint: Start simple. Don’t worry about fancy graphics yet. Colored boxes (divs) are perfect.

Step 2: Set up the files
