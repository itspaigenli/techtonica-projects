            <p class="description">No one remembers when the tradition of Tea with the Void began. Some say the first cat discovered it while gazing too long into a patch of moonlight and accidentally made eye contact with eternity. Ever since, cats have been known to sit perfectly still at odd hours, peering into corners where nothing seems to exist. Humans, ever curious (and slightly envious), started joining them — tea in hand — hoping to glimpse the secrets of the universe. No one ever sees what the cat sees. But for a few quiet minutes, everything feels both infinite and wonderfully small.</p>

                <li>One cat staring into nothing</li>
                <li>A few sprinkles of existential curiosity</li>
                <li>One cup of tea cooling slowly</li> 
                <li>A quiet, unnerving sense of cosmic mystery</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Sit beside the cat.</li> 
                <li>Let the silence stretch.</li> 
                <li>Watch the still air ripple with unseen meaning.</li>
                <li>Question everything, from the nature of being to the reason for teabags.</li> 
                <li>Sip. Realize the tea has gone cold, and perhaps that's the point.</li> 
                <li>Nibble your tea cake (if you have one) and pretend everything makes sense. It doesn't. That's fine.</li>
